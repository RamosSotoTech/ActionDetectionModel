# Action Detection Model

## Introduction
This project is about creating a model that can detect actions in a video. The model will be trained on a dataset of videos with labels for each action. The model will be able to detect the action in a video and output the label of the action.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [UCF101](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) dataset. The dataset contains 13,320 videos from 101 action categories. The videos have been collected from YouTube and have been trimmed to a length of 10s. The videos are in a variety of resolutions and frame rates. The dataset is divided into three splits: training, validation and testing. The training split contains 9,537 videos, the validation split contains 3,783 videos and the testing split contains 3,823 videos.
